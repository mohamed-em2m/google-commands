Thrilled to unveil a collaborative journey I've embarked on with Abdelmonem Mansour! ðŸš€

We've delved into the realm of Speech Classification using the powerful Google Speech Command dataset. Employing cutting-edge techniques, we harnessed MFCC for feature extraction, and then set our sights on classification.
This is where the magic happens â€“ we experimented with ANN, LSTM, and CNN models to decipher the nuances within audio.

But wait, there's more! Our project took a leap with ensemble learning, a technique that harmonizes the strengths of various models. The result? Real-time sound prediction that'll leave you in awe.
